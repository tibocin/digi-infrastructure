## PCS Core Code Documentation

### Core Modules

- [Configuration Management](./pcs/src/pcs/core/config.py) - Application configuration management using Pydantic. Includes security, database, and Redis settings with env validations.
- [Database Management](./pcs/src/pcs/core/database.py) - Async database connection management using SQLAlchemy 2.0. Handles engine/session creation, pooling, events, and health checks.

### Repositories

- [Qdrant Repository](./pcs/src/pcs/repositories/qdrant_repo.py) - Advanced Qdrant vector DB operations, embedding management, similarity search, and vector indexing with multi-tenant support.
- [Qdrant HTTP Repository](./pcs/src/pcs/repositories/qdrant_http_repo.py) - HTTP-based Qdrant operations for applications that prefer REST API over gRPC.
- [Qdrant HTTP Client](./pcs/src/pcs/repositories/qdrant_http_client.py) - HTTP client wrapper for Qdrant with connection pooling and error handling.

### Models

- [Prompt Models](./pcs/src/pcs/models/prompts.py) - Data models for prompt templates, versions, rules with SQLAlchemy ORM and enums for status and priority.

### API Endpoints

- [Health API](./pcs/src/pcs/api/v1/health.py) - Health check API endpoints for monitoring service status including basic and detailed checks.

### Additional PCS Core Modules and Components

- [Connection Pool Manager](./pcs/src/pcs/core/connection_pool_manager.py) - Unified connection pool management for Postgres, Redis, Neo4j, and Qdrant with health monitoring and performance metrics.
- [Optimized PostgreSQL Repository](./pcs/src/pcs/repositories/postgres_repo.py) - PostgreSQL-specific repository with batch processing, caching, and query optimizations.
- [Contexts Models](./pcs/src/pcs/models/contexts.py) - Data models for context types, relationships, and scopes, including validation schemas.
- [Prompts API](./pcs/src/pcs/api/v1/prompts.py) - REST API endpoints for managing prompt templates, versions, and rules.

## Digi Infrastructure Core Code Documentation

- [Port Validator](./port-management/digi-infrastructure/port-validator.py) - Validates port allocations and detects conflicts to ensure no port clashes across infrastructure services, with YAML-based configuration.
