Given this information and the fact that digi-infrastructure is the foundation data layer for postgres, chromadb, redis and neo4j. Each app has a namespace on digi-infra services. The one oddball is PCS, which is an SDK wrapper for accessing a meta information layer to improve agent operation through prompt and context management. Given this, consolidate this into markdowns README, LERNMI_OVERVIEW, SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE, LERNMI_DEVELOPMENT_PLAN. Be sure to do a deep dive and create a comprehensive plan for a BACKGROUND_AGENT_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN that is broken up into phases and steps. Each step is to be researched, evaluated, revised, and then during execution each step is unit tested. Each phase has integration tests and E2E tests. All tests must pass for each new feature added, no regressions. Development shall happen is small, focused, atomic commits. If using Python the run time is UV. If there is any additional information needed. At the end, we will need a clear DEPLOYMENT_PLAN with the needed environment and set-up including any database configuration we need to include/set-up. Provide explanation in the deployment plan in a step-by-step format.
